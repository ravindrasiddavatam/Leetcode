Code Explanation:

This code is an implementation of evaluating Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) expressions using a stack data structure. Reverse Polish Notation is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands.

Let's break down the code in detail:

The method evalRPN takes an array of strings tokens, representing the RPN expression, and returns the result of the evaluation as an integer.

Inside the method, a stack of integers stack is initialized to store intermediate results during the evaluation.

The code iterates through each token in the tokens array using an enhanced for loop.

For each token:

If the token is an operator (+, -, *, /), it pops the last two elements from the stack, performs the operation, and pushes the result back onto the stack.
If the token is a number, it parses the string token into an integer and pushes it onto the stack.
After processing all tokens, the final result is obtained by popping the only remaining element from the stack, which should be the result of the RPN expression.

Finally, the method returns the result.

Here's a more detailed explanation of the operations inside the loop:

If the token is an operator (+, -, *, /):
Pop the top two elements (b and a) from the stack.
Perform the corresponding operation (a + b, a - b, a * b, or a / b).
Push the result back onto the stack.
If the token is a number:
Parse the token into an integer.
Push the integer onto the stack.
This process continues until all tokens are processed, and the final result is obtained from the stack. This approach efficiently evaluates RPN expressions using a stack, ensuring that the operands and operators are processed in the correct order.
